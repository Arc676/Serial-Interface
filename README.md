# Serial Communication

A simple C library to provide an API for serial communication.

## Usage

The library provides an abstraction layer between the serial device and the program. The connection is established over the path to the device (e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0`). Raw bytes can be read from and written to the serial port using the available functions.

See the header file for more details.
